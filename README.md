# Wasm-is-great
WebAssembly demo

[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) is somewhat the future of the web.

On the bright side, it ends the JavaScript galore and the complex infrasctructure.

On the dark side, it close the source code and challenge accessibility, like Flash did a long time ago.

This is a project to test WebAssembly.

The result is shown at [Wasm is great](http://wasm.is-great.org/).
